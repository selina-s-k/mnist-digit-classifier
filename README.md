# MNIST Digit Classifier
This project builds a binary logistic regression model using stochastic gradient descent to detect whether a handwritten digit is a 5 or not from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Summary
- The model is trained on a subset of the MNIST dataset (`train.csv`).
- It performs binary classification: predicting if the digit is a 5 (`1`) or not (`0`).
- Training uses SGD and tracks binary cross-entropy loss over epochs.
- Final evaluation includes loss plot and validation accuracy.
